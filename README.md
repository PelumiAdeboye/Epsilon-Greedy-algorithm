Reinforcement Learning comes with its own classic example - the Multi-Armed Bandit problem. 
Never heard? No worries! Here's what it is - assume you're at a casino and in a section with some 
slot machines. Let's say you're at a section with 10 slot machines in a row and it says "Play for free! 
Max payout is 10 dollars" Each slot machine is guaranteed to give you a reward between 0 and 10 
dollars. Each slot machine has a different average payout, and you must figure out which one gives 
the most average reward so that you can maximize your reward in the shortest time possible.
